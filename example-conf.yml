    whois_show_server: opers

    # Determines whether the servers disconnecting in a netsplit should be shown when
    # relaying quits due to a netsplit. Defaults to False.
    show_netsplits: false

    # Sets the default Relay separator. Defaults to / if not specified. The "separator"
    # option in server blocks override this if specified.
    separator: "/"

    # Determines whether all nicks will be tagged by default, instead of only when a
    # nick collision happens. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you enable this, unless you're
    # absolutely sure NO ONE will be using the same nick on 2 or more networks in your
    # relay.
    # This defaults to True if not specified. Disabling this option is currently
    # experimental.
    tag_nicks: true

    # If tag_nicks is False, this specifies a list of NICK globs that network
    # tags should be added for anyways (e.g. network services).
    forcetag_nicks:
        - "*Serv"

    # This determines whether private messages & notices will be forwarded over Clientbot relay,
    # and whether the 'rpm' command will be allowed from Clientbot networks. This defaults to
    # False.
    allow_clientbot_pms: false

    # Sets the suffix that relay subservers should use. Defaults to "relay" (as in net1.relay,
    # net2.relay, etc.) if not specified.
    #server_suffix: "relay.yournet.net"

    # Sets whether Clientbot mode sync will be enabled. Valid options:
    # "full" - Sync bans, ban/invite exceptions, prefix modes, and all RFC1459-standard modes. The
    #          bot will need op in the Clientbot channel for this to work both ways.
    # "half" - Sync only bans, ban/invite exceptions, and prefix modes. The bot will need op in the
    #          Clientbot channel for this to work both ways.
    # "none" - Turns off mode sync. This is the default.
    #
    # Note: when mode sync is enabled and the bot is opped, CLAIM protection will be enforced across
    # Clientbot links as well. This means that the bot will try to revert any mode changes by non-ops
    # or services not in the channel. The workaround is to add all Clientbot networks to the CLAIM
    # list of any affected channels.
    #
    #clientbot_modesync: none

#servprotect:
    # This block configures the servprotect plugin; you don't need this if you aren't using it.

    # length: How many KILL/SAVE's before a disconnect?
    #length: 5

    # max_age: Determines how much time (in seconds) should pass before the servprotect cache is reset.
    # Note: updates to this option require a reload of the servprotect plugin, which automatically
    # resets the cache.
    #age: 10


automode:
    # The following options in this block are common to all plugins that spawn service bots (games,
    # automode, etc.):

    # Sets the nick of the Automode service, if you're using it. If not defined, this defaults to
    # the service name ("automode" in this case).
    nick: Automode
    #ident: Automode

    # For each service, you can also specify what prefix modes you want the service bot to join channels with.
    # Setting this to op (+o) for Automode makes it appear more like a standard IRC service, and lessens
    # the risk of mode overrides being dropped.
    joinmodes: 'o'

    # Determines whether a separate service bot should be spawned for this plugin. This defaults to
    # True, unless a network's protocol module doesn't support spawning extra service bots.
    # This option overrides the global "spawn_services" option defined in "bot:".
    #spawn_service: true

games:
    # Sets the nick of the Games service, if you're using it. This defaults to "games" if not defined.
    nick: Games

stats:
    # Determines the time format that the Stats plugin should use for showing dates + times.
    # Defaults to "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000" (the RFC 2812 standard) if not specified.
    time_format: "%c"
