    # Sets the fantasy command prefix for the main PyLink bot. To configure fantasy prefixes for
    # other service bots, add or modify the "prefix:" option in the configuration section of each
    # plugin. (see the "games:" block for an example)
    # Note: prior to PyLink 1.2, defining a prefix here made it global for all service bots. This
    # was removed because it called all bots in a channel at once (even if they have conflicting
    # commands), which usually leads to one successful reply and a string of "Command not found"
    # errors.
    # Note 2: this option REPLACES the deprecated "prefixes:" option from PyLink 1.1 and earlier.

login:
    # NOTE: for users migrating from PyLink < 1.1, the old login:user/login:password settings
    # have been deprecated. We strongly recommend migrating to the new "accounts:" block below, as
    # it supports multiple accounts, hashed passwords, and allows more flexibility (accounts no
    # longer imply admin access).

    # IMPORTANT: If you're switching from login:user/login:password, you MUST ADD YOURSELF to a
    # "permissions:" block like the one below, or you will lose IRC administration access to your
    # PyLink daemon!
    accounts:
        # Creates an account with username "user1". You can define other usernames at the

permissions:
    # Permissions blocks in PyLink are define as a mapping of PyLink targets (i.e. hostmasks or
    # exttargets) to lists of permission nodes. You can find a list of permissions that PyLink and
    # its plugins define in docs/permissions-reference.md. Exttargets (extended targets) are
    # documented further in docs/exttargets.md

    # Permissions blocks look something like this:
    #"*!user@host":
    #    - "permission.node.1"
    #    - "permission.node.2"
    #    - "someplugin.*"  # Wildcards are also supported in names

    # Replace ABC123 with your PyLink account name (configured above in order to give yourself admin

    # "$pylinkirc:<accountname>" (i.e. the "$pylinkirc:" prefix is implied).
    "ABC123":
        - "*"

# This option determines whether plugin-determined default permissions should be enabled.
# You should generally only disable this if you need to configure permissions in a specific way,

        ### The following options are specific to Clientbot servers:
        # SASL login: for mechanisms, only EXTERNAL (SSL cert) and PLAIN (username and password)
        # are supported so far.
        # SASL PLAIN requires the sasl_username and sasl_password options to be set, while
        # SASL EXTERNAL requires ssl, ssl_certfile, and ssl_keyfile to work.
        #sasl_mechanism: "PLAIN"
        #sasl_username: "abc"
        #sasl_password: "somestrangepassword"

        # Defines the SASL timeout - this defaults to 15 seconds.
        #sasl_timeout: 15

        # If this option is enabled, the bot will attempt SASL authentication even after it's
        # connected, as services become available throughout netsplits and reconnects.
        # Note: This requires an IRC server capable of IRCv3.2 cap-notify and sasl:

logging:

    # "none" - Turns off mode sync. This is the default.
