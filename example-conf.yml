changehost:

relay:

    # Determines whether remote opers will have user mode +H (hideoper) set on
    # them. This has the benefit of lowering the oper count in /lusers and
    # /stats (P|p), but only on IRCds that support it. This defaults to true
    # if not set.
    hideoper: true

    # Determines whether real IPs should be sent across the relay. You should
    # generally have a consensus with your linked networks on whether this should
    # be turned on. You will see other networks' user IP addresses, and they
    # will see yours. Individual networks can also opt out of IP sharing
    # both ways by defining "relay_no_ips: true" in their server block.
    show_ips: false

    # Determines whether NickServ login info should be shown in the /whois output for
    # relay users.
    # Valid options include "all" (show this to everyone), "opers" (show only to
    # opers), and "none" (disabled). Defaults to none if not specified.
    whois_show_accounts: all

    # Determines whether the origin server should be shown in the /whois output for
    # relay users.
    # Valid options include "all" (show this to everyone), "opers" (show only to
    # opers), and "none" (disabled). Defaults to none if not specified.
    whois_show_server: opers

    # Determines whether the servers disconnecting in a netsplit should be shown when
    # relaying quits due to a netsplit. Defaults to False.
    show_netsplits: false

    # Sets the default Relay separator. Defaults to / if not specified. The "separator"
    # option in server blocks override this if specified.
    separator: "/"

    # Determines whether all nicks will be tagged by default, instead of only when a
    # nick collision happens. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you enable this, unless you're
    # absolutely sure NO ONE will be using the same nick on 2 or more networks in your
    # relay.

    # This determines whether private messages & notices will be forwarded over Clientbot relay,
    # and whether the 'rpm' command will be allowed from Clientbot networks. This defaults to
    # False.
    allow_clientbot_pms: false

    # Sets the suffix that relay subservers should use. Defaults to "relay" (as in net1.relay,
    # net2.relay, etc.) if not specified.
    #server_suffix: "relay.yournet.net"

    # Sets whether Clientbot mode sync will be enabled. Valid options:
    # "full" - Sync bans, ban/invite exceptions, prefix modes, and all RFC1459-standard modes. The
    #          bot will need op in the Clientbot channel for this to work both ways.
    # "half" - Sync only bans, ban/invite exceptions, and prefix modes. The bot will need op in the
    #          Clientbot channel for this to work both ways.
    # "none" - Turns off mode sync. This is the default.
    #
    # Note: when mode sync is enabled and the bot is opped, CLAIM protection will be enforced across
    # Clientbot links as well. This means that the bot will try to revert any mode changes by non-ops
    # or services not in the channel. The workaround is to add all Clientbot networks to the CLAIM
    # list of any affected channels.
    #
    #clientbot_modesync: none

    # Determines whether messages from unknown clients (servers, clients not sharing in a -n channel,
    # etc.) should be forwarded via the PyLink server. If this is disabled, these messages will be
    # silently dropped. This defaults to True for consistency with older releases.
    #accept_weird_senders: false

    # Optionally defines a message that should be sent to all leaf channels that a network owns, when

    #     $network: the name of the network that this message is being announced to
    #     $channel: the channel that this message is being announced to
    #     $homenetwork: the name of the network that disconnected
    #     $homechannel: the original name of the channel this message is being announced to
    # If this option is empty or not set, no announcement is made.
    #disconnect_announcement: >-
    # Network $homenetwork has disconnected: $channel will remain open as the link is
    # re-established, but new links will be disabled.

#servprotect:
    # This block configures the servprotect plugin; you don't need this if you aren't using it.

    # length: How many KILL/SAVE's before a disconnect?
    #length: 5

    # age: Determines how much time (in seconds) should pass before the servprotect cache is reset.
    # Note: updates to this option require a reload of the servprotect plugin, which automatically
    # resets the cache.
    #age: 10

automode:
    # The following options in this block are common to all plugins that spawn service bots (games,
    # automode, etc.):

    # Sets the nick of the Automode service, if you're using it. If not defined, this defaults to
    # the service name ("automode" in this case).
    nick: Automode
    #ident: Automode

    # For each service, you can also specify what prefix modes you want the service bot to join channels with.
    # Setting this to op (+o) for Automode makes it appear more like a standard IRC service, and lessens
    # the risk of mode overrides being dropped.
    joinmodes: 'o'

    # Determines whether a separate service bot should be spawned for this plugin. This defaults to
    # True, unless a network's protocol module doesn't support spawning extra service bots.
    # This option overrides the global "spawn_services" option defined in "pylink:".
    #spawn_service: true

    # Defines a fantasy prefix for the Automode bot (requires spawn_services to be set and the
    # fantasy plugin to be loaded). This overrides the "prefix" option in the "pylink:" config
    # block.
    prefix: "@"

    # Determines whether this bot should respond to its nick (requires spawn_services to be set and the
    # fantasy plugin to be loaded). This overrides the "respond_to_nick" option in the "pylink:" config
    # block.
    #respond_to_nick: true

    # Determines whether we should show unknown command errors for this service bot. Defaults to True.
    # This overrides the "show_unknown_commands" option in the "pylink:" config block.
    #show_unknown_commands: true

games:
    # Sets the nick of the Games service, if you're using it. This defaults to "games" if not defined.
    nick: Games

    # Defines a fantasy prefix for the Games bot.
    prefix: "./"

stats:
    # Determines the time format that the Stats plugin should use for showing dates + times.
    # Defaults to "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000" (the RFC 2812 standard) if not specified.
    time_format: "%c"

#global:
    # Sets the text format for the global plugin, if it is loaded. This uses a template string as
    # documented at https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings, with the
    # following substitutions:
    #     $sender: the nick of the sender
    #     $network: the short network name of the origin network
    #     $fullnetwork: the full network name of the origin network
    #     $current_channel: the channel we're broadcasting on
    #     $current_network: the network we're currently broadcasting on
    #     $current_fullnetwork: the full name of the network we're currently broadcasting on
    #     $text: the global text
    #format: "[$sender@$fullnetwork] $text"
