# PyLink Permissions Reference

Below is a list of all the permissions defined by PyLink and its official plugins. For instructions on how to fine-tune permissions, see [example-permissions.yml](../example-permissions.yml).

## PyLink Core
- `core.clearqueue` - Allows access to the `clearqueue` command.
- `core.shutdown` - Allows access to the `shutdown` command.
- `core.load` - Allows access to the `load` command.
- `core.unload` - Allows access to the `unload` command.
- `core.reload` - Allows access to the `reload`, `load`, and `unload` commands. (This implies access to `load` and `unload` because `reload` is really just those two commands combined.)
- `core.rehash` - Allows access to the `rehash` command.

## Automode

By default, Automode integrates with Relay by only allowing access lists to be created / manipulated on channels that are owned by a network via Relay.

- `automode.manage` OR `automode.manage.*`: ability to manage Automode (use `setacc` and `delacc`) on all channels on the network where the user is connected.
- `automode.manage.relay_owned`: ability to manage Automode on channels owned by the current network in Relay. If Relay isn't loaded or the channel in question isn't shared via Relay, this permission check FAILS. **With the default permissions set, this is granted to all opers.**
- `automode.manage.#channel`: ability to manage Automode on the specific given channel.

- `automode.list` OR `automode.list.*`: ability to list Automode on all channels. **With the default permissions set, this is granted to all opers.**
- `automode.list.relay_owned`: ability to list automode on channels owned via Relay. If Relay isn't loaded or the channel in question isn't shared via Relay, this permission check FAILS.
- `automode.list.#channel`: ability to list Automode access entries on the specific given channel.

- `automode.sync` OR `automode.sync.*`: ability to sync automode on all channels.
- `automode.sync.relay_owned`: ability to sync automode on channels owned via Relay. If Relay isn't loaded or the channel in question isn't shared via Relay, this permission check FAILS. **With the default permissions set, this is granted to all opers.**
- `automode.sync.#channel`: ability to sync automode on the specific given channel.

- `automode.clear` OR `automode.clear.*`: ability to clear automode on all channels.
- `automode.clear.relay_owned`: ability to clear automode on channels owned via Relay. If Relay isn't loaded or the channel in question isn't shared via Relay, this permission check FAILS.
- `automode.clear.#channel`: ability to clear automode on the specific given channel.

- `automode.savedb`: ability to save the automode DB.

Remote versions of the `manage`, `list`, `sync`, and `clear` commands also exist for cross-network manipulation (e.g. `automode.remotemanage.*`)
