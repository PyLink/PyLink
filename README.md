PyLink is an extensible, plugin-based IRC services framework written in Python. It aims to be:

1) a replacement for the now-defunct Janus.

2) a versatile framework and gateway to IRC.

## Support
[![Visit our IRC channel](https://kiwiirc.com/buttons/irc.overdrivenetworks.com/pylink.png)](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.overdrivenetworks.com:+6697/?nick=ovdWebUser|?#pylink)

**First, MAKE SURE you've read the [FAQ](docs/faq.md)!**

**When upgrading between major versions, remember to read the [release notes](RELNOTES.md) for any breaking changes!**

Please report any bugs you find to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues). Pull requests are open if you'd like to contribute, though new stuff generally goes to the **devel** branch.

You can also find support via our IRC channels: `#PyLink @ irc.overdrivenetworks.com` or `#PyLink @ chat.freenode.net` (or click the button above). Ask your questions and be patient for a response.

## Installation

### Installing from source

First, make sure the following dependencies are met:

* Python 3.4+
* Setuptools (`pip3 install setuptools`)
* PyYAML (`pip3 install pyyaml`)
* [ircmatch](https://github.com/mammon-ircd/ircmatch) (`pip3 install ircmatch`)
* *For the servprotect plugin*: [expiringdict](https://github.com/mailgun/expiringdict) (install this from source; installation is broken in pip due to [mailgun/expiringdict#13](https://github.com/mailgun/expiringdict/issues/13))

1) Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink && cd PyLink`

2) Pick your branch.
* By default you'll be on the **master** (stable) branch, which is bugfix only for the most part (except when a new stable release is introduced).
* However, new features or more intensive bug fixes may not always be included. Instead, the **devel** (pre-release) branch is where active development goes, and it can be accessed by running `git checkout devel` in your Git tree.

3) Install PyLink using `python3 setup.py install` (global install) or `python3 setup.py install --user` (local install)
* Note: `--user` is a *literal* string; *do not* replace it with your username.
*  **Whenever you switch branches or update PyLink's sources via `git pull`, you will need to re-run this command for changes to apply!**

### Installing via PyPI (stable branch only)
1) Make sure you're running the right pip command: on most distros, pip for Python 3 uses the command `pip3`.

2) Run `pip3 install pylinkirc` to download and install PyLink. pip will automatically resolve dependencies.

3) Download or copy https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/blob/master/example-conf.yml for an example configuration.

## Configuration

1) Rename `example-conf.yml` to `pylink.yml` (or a similarly named `.yml` file) and configure your instance there. Note that the configuration format isn't finalized yet - this means that your configuration may break in an update!

2) Run `pylink` from the command line. PyLink will load its configuration from `pylink.yml` by default, but you can override this by running `pylink` with a config argument (e.g. `pylink mynet.yml`).

## Supported IRCds

### Primary support

These IRCds (in alphabetical order) are frequently tested and well supported. If any issues occur, please file a bug on the issue tracker.

* [charybdis](http://charybdis.io/) (3.5+ / git master) - module `ts6`
* [InspIRCd](http://www.inspircd.org/) 2.0.x - module `inspircd`
    - For vHost setting to work, `m_chghost.so` must be loaded.
    - Supported channel, user, and prefix modes are negotiated on connect, but hotloading modules that change these is not supported. After changing module configuration, it is recommended to SQUIT PyLink to force a protocol renegotiation.
* [UnrealIRCd](https://www.unrealircd.org/) 4.x - module `unreal`
    - Linking to UnrealIRCd 3.2 servers is only supported when using an UnrealIRCd 4.x server as a hub, with topology such as  `pylink<->unreal4<->unreal3.2`. We nevertheless encourage you to upgrade so all your IRCds are running the same version.

### Extended support

Support for these IRCds exist, but are not tested as frequently and thoroughly. Bugs should be filed if there are any issues, though they may not always be fixed in a timely fashion.

* [Elemental-IRCd](https://github.com/Elemental-IRCd/elemental-ircd) (6.6.x / git master) - module `ts6`
* [InspIRCd](http://www.inspircd.org/) 2.2 (git master) - module `inspircd`
* [IRCd-Hybrid](http://www.ircd-hybrid.org/) (8.2.x / svn trunk) - module `hybrid`
    - Note: for host changing support and optimal functionality, a `service{}` block / U-line should be added for PyLink on every IRCd across your network.
* [juno-ircd](https://github.com/cooper/yiria) (11.x / janet) - module `ts6` (see [configuration example](https://github.com/cooper/juno/blob/master/doc/ts6.md#pylink))
* [Nefarious IRCu](https://github.com/evilnet/nefarious2) (2.0.0+) - module `nefarious`
    - Note: Both account cloaks (user and oper) and hashed IP cloaks are optionally supported (HOST_HIDING_STYLE settings 0 to 3). Make sure you configure PyLink to match your IRCd settings.
    - For optimal functionality (mode overrides in relay, etc.), consider adding `UWorld{}` blocks / U-lines for every server that PyLink spawns.

Other TS6 and P10 variations may work, but are not officially supported.
